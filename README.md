# Getting started
To get started, open the RPC.json file and edit the contents to contain your client ID. If you want, you can change title, subtitle, large image, large image tootltip, small image, and small image tooltip.
Note: if you don't want to have a field, just leave a json field blank, for example: "smallimagename":"","smallimagetext":""
